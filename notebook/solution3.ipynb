"## Exercise 3: Implementing a KNN Algorithm with Scikit-learn\n",
"\n",
"In this exercise, we will have a brief introduction to the Scikit-learn library. We will see how this library can be used to implement the KNN algorithm in less than 20 lines of code.  Then the task will be to try to optimize the parameter of this algorithm. Don't worry! Scikit-Learn, and also de KNN algorithm will be explained very well in future modules.\n",
"\n",
"**The dataset**\n",
"\n",
"We are going to use the famous iris data set for our KNN example. The dataset consists of four attributes: sepal-width, sepal-length, petal-width and petal-length. These are the attributes of specific types of iris plant. The goal is to predict the class to which these plants belong. There are three classes in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.\n",

Overfitting means that our model works very well in known data but when it works with unseen data, it has a poor performance. To avoid this, we divide our dataset into training and test datasets. This way our algorithm is tested on un-seen data to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. We will divide it into 80% training data and 20% for testing. This 4 blocks of data would be:\n",

If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.\n",
